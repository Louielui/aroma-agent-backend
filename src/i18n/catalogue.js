 *
 * ⛔ TEMPLATES, NOT SENTENCES — and the proof is `errand.recallAnswer` below.
 *
 * The ingredient, the count and **the site's own recall title** are DATA. They sit in slots and
 * are inserted verbatim. Translation changes the frame and can never reach inside a slot. The
 * tempting mistake is to store that whole line as one translatable string, which would put a
 * supplier's or a product's own name inside the translated unit.
 *
 * ⛔ HER REPLIES ARE NOT HERE AND WILL NEVER BE. Model output is not interface text; there is no
 * key for it. Her language is the conversation contract's rule plus `traditionalGuard.js`.

 * ⚠ THIS IS THE MECHANISM'S PROOF SET, NOT THE MIGRATION. Measured: 919 production lines carry
